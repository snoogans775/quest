<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>What is the Quest?</h3>
<p>The Quest is a resource to connect video game players together. You can use this website to view lists of people's favorite video games, and submit your own list of <font style="font-size: 18px">THE GREATEST VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME.</font>

<h3>Is this like a book club? But for games?</h3>	
<p>The Quest does not require you to get dressed, and we don't all play the same game. You can follow a game from someone's list by using the <img src="images/follow_button.jpg" alt="follow"></img> button next to the game's title. Once you finish a game, you can leave your thoughts on the game with the <img src="images/complete_button.jpg" alt="complete"></img> button next to the game's title, found in 'Your Quest'. </p>

<h3>I am more confused than before...</h3>
<p>First things first, you need to make a list of your favorite games. To do this, you will need to <a href="new_user.php">register an account on the Quest</a>. Once you have an account, you can create your list, earn points by completing challenges from other people's lists, and keep track of your score.

<h3>Can I change games in my list?</h3>
<p>You can currently add and subtract games willy-nilly. An edit button is in the works. Once another person looks at your list, you really shouldn't be able to change that. So at some point, we'll have to decide to commit to our lists. In the past, this has been accomplished by having set contests that start and end at specified dates.</p>
	
<h3>Are there ways to earn points?</h3>
<p>This is the beta version of the Quest website. I have lots of ideas. I would like games to have tags based on the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/227531/fourteen_forms_of_fun.php">'14 fourteen forms of fun'</a>. You could earn extra points by playing games from each tag. Post your suggestions at the Forum! I'd love to hear them.</p>
	
<h3>What if my game doesn't have an ending?</h3>
<p>Indeed! Because some games do not have a clear ending accompanied by a credits screen and fanfare, you can add a required challenge. If you choose this option, it will be visible to anyone brwosing your list.</p>
