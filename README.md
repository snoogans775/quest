# The Quest
A "game club" platform for the Reno Video Game Symphony

A user-submission interface to inspire critical thinking about interactive media. Users create lists. The lists serve to recommend titles for others. An personalized email newsletter keeps users up to date and invites users to participate in events.
## How it works
Create lists of favorite games. Play games from the lists. Write summaries and analyses.

The Quest was an educational platform that ran from 2012-2016. For more information, contact Kevin Fredericks at kfrednv@gmail.com

## What needs help?
Any pulls are welcome. The site was made in vanilla PHP so everything is right there for you to change.

## Dependencies:
PHP 5.3+
MySQL
Newsletter depends on PHPMailer library

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Andrew Musselman for his help developing amusselm-gamequest, a Django prototype for this project.
